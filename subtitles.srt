1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,980
 As you probably have noticed, I put up here on my shared screen the part of the webpage.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,720
 Most of the class is driven from the schedule.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,940
 I'll talk a little bit later about it.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,040
 But, you know, hopefully you find the URL and you found the schedule.

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,280
 I'll return to that a little bit later in more detail.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:24,720
 Okay.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,520
 So what's the plan for today?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,920
 So I'm going to talk a little bit about what is a distributed system.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,120
 So what is it?

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:44,940
 And maybe give a little bit of historical context, you know, how distributed systems have developed over the last couple decades.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,980
 Then hit a little bit on the core structure, like what you should expect.

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,580
 Then talk.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,800
 What are the main.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,360
 Topics or the main recurring topics that we'll see throughout the term.

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,940
 And then we'll see actually first illustration of those main topics by the case study.

16
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,440
 That was assigned for today, the paper MapReduce, which is also the topic of the first lap.

17
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:26,380
 And you watch the Piazza, you know, we just posted that to the lab on Piazza URL so that you can get going.

18
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,560
 And it's due next Friday.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,940
 So let's start with the basics.

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,120
 I'll talk a little bit about what is a distributed system.

21
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,200
 And sort of, you know, maybe easy to start with a little picture.

22
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,580
 The internet, the cloud.

23
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,200
 Yeah.

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,200
 We have computers connected to clients and maybe servers.

25
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,800
 Maybe you have servers.

26
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,680
 You have servers that actually are complete data centers.

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,320
 Clients.

28
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,940
 And data centers themselves, you know, may be internally distributed systems that are connected by internal networks.

29
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,600
 The data centers themselves might be internal connections, you know, outside of the internet.

30
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,200
 But there's a large collection of computers connected by networks.

31
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,820
 And, you know, sort of, you know, you can see that there's a lot of data centers that are connected by networks.

32
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:37,880
 And, you know, sort of, informally, you know, the way I think about it, what a distributed system is, that there's a multiple, you know, more than one computer network.

33
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,080
 You know, so they can interact only through, you know, sending or receiving packets.

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,460
 As opposed to, say, a multiprocessor where you can interact through shared memory.

35
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,460
 And they're cooperating, you know, to deliver some service.

36
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,860
 So those are sort of the four keywords, you know, that define, you know, for me.

37
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,560
 Distributed systems.
